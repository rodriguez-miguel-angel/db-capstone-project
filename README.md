# db-capstone-project

I completed a capstone project in which I created a database and client for Little Lemon restaurant. To complete this course, I needed database engineering experience from the previous courses.

## Introduction
The Capstone project enables me to demonstrate multiple skills from the Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problem. I demonstrated my new skillset by designing and composing a database solution, combining all the skills and technologies I've learned throughout this program to solve the problem at hand. I have proven your ability to: set up a database project, add sales reports, create a table booking system, work with data analytics and visualization, and create a database client.
